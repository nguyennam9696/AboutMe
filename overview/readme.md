# Overview

Career Week will provide a foundational overview of the information you will need to be a competitive job seeker. You will be expected to attend all four days of Career Week and participate actively in all activities.

You will also be expected to complete the following forms: Graduate Information Form (pre-career week), the Career Week Feedback Form (after Career Week), and the Employment Verification Form (post-employment)

Career Week runs from Tuesday to Friday the week after Graduation. Each day, Career Week starts at 10:00am and ends at 5:00pm. Lunches will generally be one hour long.


Job Search Expectations

If learning to code at DBC is like being in freefall, Career Week is like finally pulling the ripcord on your parachute. Coming out of the program and moving into a slower, less structured phase can be jarring.

Your job search is going to feel weird. Lean into it. There are going to be high highs and low lows. The great part is you’re going to go through them together as a cohort. It’s going to be rough, but it’s going to lead to your new life.

It may feel weird to compete with your cohort mates for jobs. The cohorts that do the best are the ones who lean on each other and just acknowledge the awkwardness of competition. Your ability to support one another will help smooth out the highs and lows of a prolonged search. After the DBC experience, it is easy to feel isolated and uncertain.

Stay active with your coding projects during the job! You have learned a lot over the last 9-15 weeks, but it’s all short term memory. Use it or lose it! You will need to balance your job search with growing as a developer.

Your job search is probably going to take longer than you think. Even after
The broader and more flexible your expectations are, the easier your job search will be. Don’t rule out internships and apprenticeships. Many people turn down three month internships, only to continue job searching for three months when they could have been coding every day and searching too.

Graduating from DBC is tough, but finding a job is even tougher. Career Week provides tools that help grads search smarter, not harder. So breathe, get support, and get ready to lean in!
