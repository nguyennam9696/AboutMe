Graduate Careers Agreement

Congratulations on completing Dev Bootcamp! This is a huge accomplishment, and is telling of your drive and passion. As hard as that was, the next phase of your journey will be even tougher – landing a great job! The right job for you is out there, and Dev Bootcamp has resources available to assist with the job search process.

To gain access to support with your job search, you will need to opt-in to Career Services with Dev Bootcamp. Read below to learn how to get started.

What Role Does a Career Coach Play in My Search?
Everyone’s job search is different, and the Career Team strives to meet the needs of the individual. Career Coaches lay the foundation for a successful search during Career Week, through lectures and workshops. During the week, graduates gain access to a variety of tools and tips, each of which will help propel them to success during their individual search. Support systems are also set in place through accountability groups, Accountability Monday feedback, and requested 1:1’s with Career Coaches to help maintain motivation during the emotionally challenging process of searching.

Why Do I Need to Opt-In?
The Career Team is here to support your job search, not do it for you. To start working with Career Services you will need to commit to the following agreements, each of which is critical for you to receive the full benefit of what the Career Team has to offer.

To opt-in, I agree to…

complete the Graduate Information Form (pre-career week)
complete the Employment Verification Form (post-employment)
attend all four days of Career Week and actively participate in all activities
start my job search right after Career Week
complete an Accountability Monday form each week until I get a job
be punctual to meetings
provide two-hour notice in case of appointment cancellation
utilize previously provided resources and then ask for help
actively participate with my accountability group until everyone is employed
bring my whole self to my job search, 1:1’s, and my accountability groups
respond to career coach correspondence within 48 hours
Share career news with Career Services

Those who fail to meet these accountabilities will be at risk of losing the privilege of Career Services support. This will be at the discretion of the Career Coach and the Head of Career Services. Those who lose their privileges may be granted one repeat which will provide an additional opportunity to receive Career Services support moving forward.

What Can I Expect From the Career Team?
Just as we ask for your agreement, you in turn can expect to work with a dedicated Career Coach. We will hold ourselves to the following standards in our work with you and other graduates.

When providing services, Career Coaches will……

be fully present during Career Week and incorporate feedback
respond to requests for support and resources within 48 hours
schedule 1:1 meetings on an as-needed basis and arrive on time
bring our whole selves to all 1:1 meetings to provide emotional support, information, guidance, and feedback

If at any time, you are unsatisfied with the quality of support you are receiving from career services, please email our Head of Career Services, Jill Felska, at jill@devbootcamp.com.
